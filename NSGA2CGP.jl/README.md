# NSGA2CGP.jl

The goal of this project is to use NSGA-II to evolve CGP individuals using the Cambrian framework. This project has been stopped in order to develop an implementation of NSGA-II applicable to any Cambrian individual. You can find this implementation here https://github.com/SuReLI/NSGA-II.jl
